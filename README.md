# Retro Productivity

Retro Productivity is a 90’s-inspired web app designed to help you stay focused and energized. It brings together a classic Pomodoro timer, a persistent To-Do list, curated music streams and a live webcam “window” to the world-all wrapped in a playful retro interface with light/dark themes.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer**  
  Set your own work and break intervals, start/pause/reset with a single click, and watch a digital countdown in true pixel-perfect style.  

- **Persistent To-Do List**  
  Quickly jot down tasks, mark them as done or delete them—and they’ll stay saved in your browser’s localStorage until you clear them.  

- **Music & Lofi Streams**  
  Choose from a selection of radio stations or soothing lofi channels to build the perfect focus soundtrack.  

- **Live Webcam Window**  
  Peek through a virtual “window” at live cityscapes and landscapes, bringing a breath of fresh air to your workflow.  

- **Light & Dark Modes**  
  Flip between nostalgic neon-bright and sleek dark palettes to match your mood or time of day.
